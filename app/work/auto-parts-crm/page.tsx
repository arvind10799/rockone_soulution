              Intracia Technologies runs MEE Auto Parts, a US aftermarket parts operation
              where a single sale touches quoting, order entry, invoicing, e-signature,
              carrier handoff, and payment follow-up.
            </p>
            <p>
              The team was fast on the phone and slow on the paperwork. Leads were tracked in
              one place, orders in another, invoices in a third, and shipping status nowhere
              at all. Every handoff between those systems was a re-typed record and a chance
              to lose a sale.
            </p>
            <p>
              We designed and built the CRM that holds all of it on one record — from the
              first inbound call to a signed invoice and a tracked delivery.
